### Introduction

-------------------------------------

This article presents daily numbers and insights on COVID-19 infections for Belgium, the EU28 and most infected countries in the world.
By combining different statistics, we want to better understand where we are in the trajectory of the epidemic, taking the current policy measures as given.
We report the number and growth rates of cases and deaths by country, and more detailed information on hospitalization, cases and deaths for Belgium.
We also estimate a real-time epidemic curve, which gets updated daily. This curve serves as a blueprint for the predicted trajectory of the epidemic.

Today's key numbers:

- Global: 1,391,890 total cases, and 81,478 deaths in 204 countries with reported COVID-19 cases.

- EU28: 627,208, and 55,750 deaths.

- Belgium: 22,967 total cases, 5,688 total hospitalised, 1,276 in intensive care, 1,008 on respiration, 2,240 deceased, and 4,680 released.

**Note 1**: We report statistics based on the number of confirmed COVID cases and deaths.
These world-wide available daily numbers are informative and the best which are available cross-country. However, they are not perfect.

First, the number of infected people is indisputably much higher than the reported number of cases per country.
Not everyone is, will be, nor can be, tested.
This is due to a combination of technical constraints (it is simply impossible to test the whole population), policy constraints (who to test if there are limited resources to test), and the presence of asymptomatic infected people that might not be tested if testing is focused on symptomatic patients.
See [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-28/confirmed-coronavirus-cases-is-an-almost-meaningless-metric) for a short discussion on testing policies.
Second, cross-country differences in infection rates are in part driven by differences in testing policies, which can also vary over time.
This implies that both across- and within-country numbers based on the number of cases and deaths (including standard measures such as case-fatality rates etc.) are partly driven by these (changes in) testing policies, and therefore not only reflect the evolution of the virus per se.
Third, up to today, the number of cases does not convey the severity of the disease by case.
Health care data scientists would need much more detailed information on tested people to help make informed policy decisions on when/how to close and open up again: positive/negative, demographics, pre-existing conditions, etc.
For some countries (including Belgium), information on the number of hospitalized patients is available, which is arguably a better measure than confirmed cases.
Finally, there are [several sources of over, under and late reporting](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200401-coronavirus-why-death-and-mortality-rates-differ)) of the number of deaths, which again can vary over time and across countries.
For Belgium, one source of lagged reporting of deaths is the transmission of numbers outside hospitals to Epistat (e.g. from retirement homes).
In general, differences in testing across countries leads to differences in death cause attribution.
We take these observations as given.

### 1. Daily updates for Belgium <a name="cap1"></a>

-------------------------------------

We start with the analysis of daily updated data for Belgium.

Figure 1 shows total COVID numbers for confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deceased patients by date.[^1]

[^1]: There is a possible lag in reporting as numbers from different sources have to be collected and disseminated by Epistat. We present the latest available numbers each day.

There are 22,967 confirmed infections, 5,688 hospitalized patients, 1,276 patients in intensive care, with 1,008 patients on respiratory aid, and 2,240 people have died from the infection.
On the up side, 4,680 patients have been released from the hospital.
As of today, there is a current maximum capacity of 2,293 ICU beds reserved for COVID patients, and there is 55.65% capacity of ICU beds taken.

A case is recorded as the date of symptoms onset, sampling, diagnosis, or reporting.
While the numbers of cases are a very noisy measure (see Note 1 in the introduction), the detailed information on hospitalizations for Belgium are more informative for the virus spread.
The hospitalization numbers also reflect the severity of the outbreak. Moreover, they are key numbers to measure the load on the health care system when flattening the curve matters.[^2]

[^2]: If the hospital capacity constraint would become binding at some moment, hospitalization numbers would be under-reporting as severely ill people stay at home.

{% include plots/daily-update-2020-04-08/Belgium_cumulative.html %}
*Figure 1: Number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Belgium.*  

Next, figure 2 shows the number of cases and hospitalized patients by province, for the latest available date.[^3]

[^3]: There is currently no information on the number of deceased patients by province. These numbers by province can be lagged, and we present the latest available data.
Most provinces are comparably affected, with the exception of Luxembourg and Namur who have much lower numbers.

{% include plots/daily-update-2020-04-08/Belgium_province.html %}
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Figure 2: Number of cases and hospitalizations by province.</p>

Then, we show the number of cases by city in Figure 3.[^4]

[^4]: At the moment, there is only info on the number of cases by city, not on hospitalized or deceased patients.

The city with the highest number of infections is Antwerpen with 866. Luik follows with 526 and Bergen is third with 426 cases.
In absolute terms, Flanders is much more infected than Wallonia, and these infections are also spread out across most cities.

*Figure 3: Number of cases by municipality.*

Next, we compare the life tables for Belgium against the distribution of COVID deaths across age groups.
We start by showing the life expectancy curve for Belgians in Figure 4.[^5]

[^5]: We average the densities over the years 2015-2017 to wash out year-specific peaks in mortality. In 2018, there was an influenza epidemic that generated significant over-mortality in the elderly.

The curve plots the probability of being dead by a certain age for each year of age (cumulative distribution function).
For example, the probability of being dead by age 100 is close to one.
The curve is shown for both sexes jointly, and male and female separately.
This graph also shows that females have in general a higher life expectancy than males, as is well known.

We then overlay the deaths by age group reported in the COVID data.[^6]

[^6]: There are some deaths reported without information on age, we drop these for the CDF calculations. Since COVID mortality is given by age bins, we also bin the life tables. For each age bin (0-24 years, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+), we take the midpoint.

We present the graphs separately for both sexes, to account for differences in general life expectancy.
Note that, while the life tables are fixed, the COVID death tolls by age are updated daily.
This implies that the COVID curve might change over the course of the disease, if for example elderly people die before younger people in the outbreak.
At the end of the epidemic, the probability distribution of dying from COVID by age will be fixed.

For both sexes, we see that the distribution of COVID mortality is skewed towards the elderly, with a turning point at around 70 years.
In other words, more elderly people die from COVID compared to other age groups, than predicted by the life tables.
Importantly, this data does not account for pre-existing conditions, some of which might be a plausible risk factor for COVID diseases (diabetes, vascular diseases etc.)
Moreover, both age and pre-existing conditions are positively correlated, so it is not clear whether the risk of dying from COVID is mostly related to either of these factors.
More detailed data on pre-existing conditions by age would be an enormous help in disentangling both factors. Unfortunately, this data is not (yet) available for Belgium.

We also compare COVID deaths by region (Brussels, Flanders, Wallonia) against the Belgian life tables.
There might be regional differences (e.g. from health care capacity or quality). At this stage, there is no clear distinguishable pattern.

*Figure 4: Life expectancy versus distribution of COVD deaths by age groups and region.*

We end the analysis for Belgium with an estimated real-time epidemic curve for both cases and deaths in Figure 5.
The epicurve reports the fraction of total cases/deaths over the span of the disease.
When people talk about "flattening the curve", THIS is the curve.

The curve provides information on the speed (growth rate by day) and severity (number of cases/deaths) of the COVID epidemic, and are important blueprints to benchmark further outbreaks of the disease in the future.
Some examples of epicurves for [Mers-Cov](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43586-9), [SARS](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/epicurve/epiindex/en/index1.html), [influenza in Canada](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2010.00154.x) and [influenza in Belgium](https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/influenza/).

The main issue is that true epicurves are only available at the end of a disease.
At that moment, there is information on the full distribution of cases/deaths over time per country (conditional on all the remarks on the measurement of cases and deaths).
Still, we construct epicurves for Belgium while the disease evolves, as follows.[^7]

[^7]: This is a model-based estimation of the epicurves. Assumptions on the underlying model(s) will affect the predicted growth paths.

We do not pretend to provide the best predictive model, and more complex but refined methods are available, such as [Bayesian estimation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002185).

First, we target one or more countries that have potentially completed the first wave of the disease. We use these countries as a benchmark epicurve.
As of today, we use only China as a benchmark.[^8]

[^8]: Typically, epicurves are benchmarked against earlier epidemics of the same disease in the same country. Here, we do a cross-country analysis in real time.

It is important to stress that not every country follows the identical same trajectory as the benchmark countries.
There can be several mechanisms such as different policies, population density and geographic heterogeneity, leading to different trajectories.
However, conditional on these mechanisms, we do not expect these trajectories of the virus to be vastly different across outbreaks.
As more countries will complete the outbreak cycle, they will contribute to the benchmark of the "true" epicurve for COVID for other countries still completing their cycles.[^9]

[^9]: In other words, we keep an eye on these epicurves as more countries pass the first peak and this solidifies the structure of the general epicurve.

We plot the epicurve for China as follows.
We calculate the number of cases or deaths over time for each country, relative to the peak of the outbreak, i.e. the day with the most reported cases or deaths (time 0).
Next, to compare across other outbreaks over time or across countries, we rescale the number of cases/deaths to a daily share in the total outbreak for that country cycle.
We plot the curve from the moment 0.1% of cases/deaths are reported to avoid excessive noise in the positioning of the curve.

Second, only for countries that have completed their cycle, the peak is known.
For countries still evolving, we forecast their peak using time series prediction models on the daily growth rates.
A peak arrives when the growth rate turns zero, and then turns negative afterwards.
In particular, we predict future growth rates using a simple ARIMA model. The optimal number of lags are chosen from a model comparison across a grid of lag estimates using the AIC/BIC criteria.
Based on the predicted peak (on the *x*-axis), we can recalibrate the share of infections (on the *y*-axis) as a fraction of the total predicted number retrieved from the current cases and predicted growth rates.

Third, we compare cases and deaths over time as the outbreak evolves, and we re-estimate, fit and update these curves daily.

These estimations suggest that China has experienced a turning point at around 25-30 days for the number of cases.
We do see signs however, of a starting second wave in China, both in terms of cases and deaths.
It is too early to draw conclusions for Belgium, but we might be hopeful that we are around the peak, with around zero growth rates and similar lead times to the peak (25-30 days).

At this stage, it is important to note that:
(i) these curves change daily, with the difference between the estimated and the true curve going to zero as a country completes a cycle.
(ii) growth rates, and thus the epicurves, are affected by the particular policies in place, and the moment they are implemented. Too early lifting of measures can and will result in a direct second wave.
(iii) it is highly probable that additional waves will arrive within a country. As of today, it is not certain that China has finished its full cycle, or that there are additional cycles coming up.
(iv) these figures do not serve as any policy measure in any way. They only serve to get an estimate of the epicurves in real time, instead of waiting until the end of the outbreak.

### 2. Number of cases, world and EU28 <a name="cap2"></a>

-------------------------------------

#### 2.1 Number of cases

We continue with reporting the number of cases for the 10 most infected countries in the world and the EU28.
Some of these graphs are very similar to the popular graphs in the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest).[^10]

[^10]:You can use the dropdown menu to select variants of the same curve. All graphs are interactive, and allow for a sub-selection of countries.

Figure 6 shows the total number of cases over time.
The country with the most cases is United States of America with 398,809 total confirmed cases.
Second is Spain with 140,510 confirmed cases, and Italy follows, with 135,586 cases.

The first tab reports the total number of cases (in log scale), since the 100th confirmed case within that country.
In the initial outbreak phase, the epidemic spreads exponentially, not arithmetically, i.e a log scale is the natural way to track the spread.
Synchronizing dates since the 100th confirmed case allows to compare the speed and evolution of the epidemic across countries.

However, [exponential growth curves cannot continue forever](https://medium.com/data-for-science/epidemic-modeling-101-or-why-your-covid19-exponential-fits-are-wrong-97aa50c55f8),
and growth has to decline at some moment due to constraints on the population its is passing through (conceptually, the availability of next victims to infect for various reasons (policies, geography, density...)).
China has been stabilizing since the end of February, signalling that the first peak has passed.
However, new domestic cases signal the possible onset of a second wave.
Several countries show a decline in the increase of the number of new daily cases, hopefully pointing to passing a peak, or at least a stabilization of the number of infected people.
However, many countries are still facing exponential growth rates (linear in logs), signalling those countries face the onset of the pandemic.

We repeat the graph for the 10 most infected countries in the EU28.
The EU28 country with the most cases is Spain with 140,510 total confirmed cases.
Second is Italy, with 135,586 confirmed cases, and Germany follows, with 103,228 cases.
It's worth noting that Sweden's infection rate has decreased significantly since around the 9th day after the 100th confirmed case, while having a [rather lenient policy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2020/03/30/why-swedens-coronavirus-approach-is-so-different-from-others/#538677cb562b) towards the spread of the virus.  

{% include plots/daily-update-2020-04-08/2020-04-08-ln_cum_cases-after_100th.html %}
*Figure 6: Total cases still show close to exponential growth rates for countries like the USA and UK.*

#### 2.2 Number of cases as a share of the population

Figure 7 shows the total number of cases, as a share of the population, since the case that led to crossing the 0.01% cases/population threshold.
Absolute numbers are a key statistic in the onset of the epidemic, as they relate to the number of people infected from one patient.
Moreover, in standard S(E)IR models, the number of infected people rises almost identical in countries with vastly different population sizes.
The first few weeks in the outbreak, higher per-capita numbers mostly imply smaller countries, not different policies or growth rates.
However, as the epidemic evolves over time and reaches a steady state, a certain fraction of the population will be infected.
A significant part of the friction the virus encounters, and which in turn affects its growth rate, is country-specific: policy measures, geographic dispersion, population density etc.

Tab 1 shows these numbers for the 10 most infected countries in the world, tab 2 does this for the top 10 EU28 countries.
As of today, the EU28 has an average infection rate of 0.096%/0.005%, calculated as the total number of cases/deaths over the EU28 population.
This is still far off the [projections](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/the-latest-on-the-coronavirus/) of 30-70% of adult world population ultimately being infected.
There are at least four plausible scenarios:
(i) real infection rates are orders of magnitude larger than reported ones. If we are at the end of the epidemic, this implies real infection rates are around 100-300 times larger than currently reported.
We will never know the true infection rate (due to significant under-testing and a sizeable fraction of asymptomatic infected), and only obtain a guess at the end of the epidemic.
(ii) the epidemic is only in its onset, and we expect to reach higher infection rates. Given that most countries have not passed their first peak yet, this is a plausible scenario.
(iii) we are reaching the end of the epidemic, and infection rates are much lower than projected. Given the growth rates and our initial estimates for epidemic curves discussed below, we believe this scenario is not probable at this moment.
(iv) flattening-the-curve policies lowers the speed with which the epidemic rages. It is not clear yet whether these policies affect the total infection rate at the end of the epidemic.
With these policies in place, the share of infected population can grow at a lower rate but over a longer period.

*Figure 7: Correcting for population size, the most infected countries are Spain, Switzerland and Belgium.*

#### 2.3 Growth rate of the number of cases

Next, we plot the evolution of growth rates of the number of cases in Figure 8.
Growth rates are expressed in percentage changes from date *t-1* to *t*.[^11]

[^11]: The growth rate on absolute numbers is identical to one calculated as cases per million inhabitants.

We take a 3-day simple moving average to account for strong fluctuations from e.g. reporting lags within countries.
Each country wants to see this growth rate going to zero as soon as possible.

Two things are worth noting.
First, the slopes, or decreases in growth rates, are not the same across countries.
Second, even smoothed by a 3-day moving average, these growth rates are not monotonically decreasing.
This might be partially due to temporal new outbursts of the virus within countries, or to increased testing policies.[^12]

[^12]: Approximating these growth rates with a 4th-order polynomial fit (not shown) also shows these non-monotonicities.

*Figure 9: Growth rates are declining for most countries, but some stay fluctuating at high levels.*

### 3. Number of deaths, world and EU28 <a name="cap3"></a>

-------------------------------------

#### 3.1 Number of deaths

As noted in the introduction, the number of cases is prone to several important sources of non-random measurement error.
While measurement error also exists for the number of deaths, this number draws a clearer (but morbid) picture.

Figure 10 shows the total number of deaths for the top 10 countries with the deadliest outbreak over time.
As of today, the country with the most deaths is Italy, with 17,129 deaths.
Second is Spain, with 13,798 deaths, and the United States of America follows, with 12,895 deaths.

The first tab plots the total number of deaths (in log scale) since the 10th death.
Again, we see that China has stabilized for now, with around 3,500 deaths.
Since the second half of February, China has been overtaken by Italy and Spain.
Since April 1, the USA is the country with the third highest number of deaths due to COVID.
Most western countries are on a similar trajectory as Italy, with Spain faring worse, and Sweden and Germany being on a better growth path.
There are however differences in how countries count deaths related to COVID, which might partially explain differences in levels.
If these methods remain the same within countries, the evolution of death rates within countries is still informative.

The second tab shows the same total number of deaths by date, in levels.

We repeat the graph for the 10 highest mortality countries in the EU28 in tab 2.
The EU28 country with the most deaths is Italy, with 17,129 deaths. Second is Spain, with 13,798, and France follows, with 10,328 deaths.

*Figure 10: Evolution of mortality by country (top 10).*

#### 3.2 Number of deaths as a share of the population

Figure 11 shows the total number of deaths as a fraction of the population for these top 10 countries.
Correcting for country size, Italy and Spain are still ahead of other countries. However, Belgium and the UK are on a similar trajectory.

*Figure 11: Total deaths, per million population.*

#### 3.3 Growth rate of the number of deaths

We plot the evolution of growth rates of the number of deaths in Figure 12.
The growth rate of Italy is slowing down relatively fast, a hopeful sign.
However, other countries like the United States or the United Kingdom, so not see steady declining growth rates yet.

*Figure 12: Growth rates, number of deaths.*

#### 3.4. Estimated epidemic curves, world and EU28

We conclude with an estimate of real-time epidemic curves for cases and deaths, for both the top 10 world countries and the EU in Figure 14.
These initial projections suggest that China has experienced a turning point at around 25-30 days. Italy might be on a similar track with a turning point at around 30 days.
Most other countries however, still face increasing rates of infections and deaths.

We are back with updated numbers tomorrow.
In the mean time, stay safe, and take care of yourself and of others.
